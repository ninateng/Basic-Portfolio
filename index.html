<!--
Struggled a ton in this project, sumbitting my efforts.
It is just the "about me" portion. I will be resubmitting it
when it is refined. I would love feedback on a finished product!

Issues:
- navigation bar needs to be on the right instead of left, 
    some of the nav are missing????
- unable to put top margin for center div
- name bar is also in the incorrect postion, good shape but that's it
- attempted to wrap text but wasn't able to have text fully top to bottom
    of div

You guys will definately be seeing me more often during office hours

            <p>I love to explore different opportunities related to computer science. I am very interested in becoming an intern at Costco Wholesale. This internship will help me discover more about the different career pathways in the computer science field. By participating in the program, I expect to gain a better understanding of how a team functions and their daily work in the information systems division. I also hope to get a better understanding of the other roles there are of the executive management and other various ones at Costco Wholesale headquarters.

                In participation of the Internship program I am confident that this will impact my future goals. It will result in intensifying my goals, help me hone in on a career pathway in IT, and assist me to choose more specific classes in my academic program that will give me a better foundation.
                
                Although I have successfully led group projects in a class setting, outside of that I am currently a nanny to two families and tutor one out of the three children. The mothers give me a list of tasks to be completed. These tasks include various things such as cleaning, cooking, and tutoring in all subjects. I strategize ways to ensure efficient use of time and the level of priority. The parents have entrusted me with their children as well as completion of their tasks given. In my work I am able to manage my time and help lead a team by exercising skills such as interpersonal communication, adaptability, and problem solving.
